When a git repository is created in an O/S folder, all changes to files in that folder are recorded in a hidden folder called .git located at the root of the repository. A copy of that .git folder can be shared with other developers on a Git server in the cloud such as Github or Bitbucket.
In order to share a set of changes on a branch, all the changed files need to be [[Add]]ed to a commit that needs to be [[Commit]]ted to the local .git folder. The branch then needs to be [[Push]]ed to the shared repository in order to be shared with other developers.
