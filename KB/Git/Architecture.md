When a git repository is created in an O/S folder, all changes to files in that folder are recorded in a hidden folder called .git located at the root of the repository. A copy of that .git folder can be shared with other developers on a Git server in the cloud such as Github or Bitbucket.
In order to share a set of changes on a branch, all the changed files need to be staged that needs to be committed to the local branch. The branch then needs to be pushed to a remote branch in order for it to be shared with other developers.
