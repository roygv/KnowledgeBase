VSCode and PyCharm have a good built-in support for Git. A few extensions are available to do even more. However the best Git experience is to use a dedicated GUI. 
Here are my favorites:
[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client): Free for public and local repos. [Pricing](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client/gkc-pricing_v2)

[GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/): Free. Best integration with GitHub
