If we have a remote Git branch, for example a branch on Github, it can happen that the remote branch has commits that the current branch doesn't have! Maybe another branch got merged, your colleague pushed a quick fix, and so on.

We can get these changes locally, by performing a `git fetch` on the remote branch! It doesn't affect your local branch in any way: a `fetch` simply downloads new data.

We can now see all the changes that have been made since we last pushed! We can decide what we want to do with the new data now that we have it locally.
