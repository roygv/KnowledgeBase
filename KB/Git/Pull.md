Although a `git fetch` is very useful in order to get the remote information of a branch, we can also perform a `git pull`. A `git pull` is actually two commands in one: a `git fetch`, and a `git merge`. When we're pulling changes from the origin, we're first fetching all the data like we did with a `git fetch`, after which the latest changes are automatically merged into the local branch.

Awesome, we're now perfectly in sync with the remote branch and have all the latest changes!
