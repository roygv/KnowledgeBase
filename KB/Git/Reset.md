It can happen that we committed changes that we didn't want later on. Maybe it's aÂ `WIP`Â commit, or maybe a commit that introduced bugs! In that case, we can perform aÂ `git reset`.

AÂ `git reset`Â gets rid of all the current staged files and gives us control over whereÂ `HEAD`Â should point to.

## Soft reset

AÂ _soft reset_Â movesÂ `HEAD`Â to the specified commit (or the index of the commit compared toÂ `HEAD`), without getting rid of the changes that were introduced on the commits afterward!

Let's say that we don't want to keep the commitÂ `9e78i`Â which added aÂ `style.css`Â file, and we also don't want to keep the commitÂ `035cc`Â which added anÂ `index.js`Â file. However, we do want to keep the newly addedÂ `style.css`Â andÂ `index.js`Â file! A perfect use case for a soft reset.

When typingÂ `git status`, you'll see that we still have access to all the changes that were made on the previous commits. This is great, as this means that we can fix the contents of these files and commit them again later on!

## Hard reset

Sometimes, we don't want to keep the changes that were introduced by certain commits. Unlike a soft reset, we shouldn't need to have access to them any more. Git should simply reset its state back to where it was on the specified commit: this even includes the changes in your working directory and staged files! ğŸ’£

Git has discarded the changes that were introduced onÂ `9e78i`Â andÂ `035cc`, and reset its state to where it was on commitÂ `ec5be`.
