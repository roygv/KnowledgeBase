[[Rebase]]: copies the commits from the current branch, and puts these copied commits on top of the specified branch
[[Interactive rebase]]: Before rebasing the commits, we can modify them! We can do so with an _interactive rebase_
[[Reset]]: A `git reset` gets rid of all the current staged files and gives us control over where `HEAD` should point to.
[[Revert]]: Another way of undoing changes by creating a new commit that restores a previous state
[[Cherry Pick]]: create a new commit on our active branch that contains the changes that were introduced by the `cherry-pick`ed commit.
[[Reflog]]: show a log of all the actions that have been taken
[[Fetch]]: Get changes from the remote branch to the local one **without** moving the HEAD
[[Merge]]: Create a new commit which merges two branches without changing them
[[Pull]]: Fetch + Merge
